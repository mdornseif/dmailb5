#The server sends "you talk of peace and prepare for war\nv1 gzip
rijndael\n", "v1 gzip rijndael blocksize 1024" indicates protocol
version and may be changed in further relases. Then the server sends
16 bytes of data as token/connection ID.

The client sends a netstring containing his username. The username is
case sensive. then he sends back the 16 byte token encrypted with the
connection key and and 32 bit unsigned integer in network byte order
specifing the line speed in bytes per second between the client and
the server. If the client has no idea of the line speed he may
announce 0. The line speed is used by the server to decide which
compression ratio to use.

Then the server starts sending any number of Datablocks While reciving
DATABLOCKS the client may send DELETIONREQUSTS any time.

Example:

<<< "you talk of peace and prepare for war\n" 
<<< "v1 gzip rijndael blocksize 1024\n"
<<< ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP 
>>> 6:doobee, 
>>> xENCRYPTEDTOKENx
>>> LINESPED
<<< DATABLOCK
<<< DATABLOCK
>>> DELETIONREQUEST
<<< DATABLOCK
<<< DATABLOCK
<<< DATABLOCK
<<< DATABLOCK
>>> DELETIONREQUEST
<<< DATABLOCK
>>> DELETIONREQUEST
>>> DELETIONREQUEST

DATABLOCKS are netstrings consisting of a byte indicating the
datatype, and the data itself.

DATATYPES
E errormessage
P encrypted compressed payload (CPAYLOAD)
L last message send by the server

Example: 
42:Etemporary error: can't read your Maildir/,
64:P1234567890qwertzuiopasdfghjkl#yxcvbnmasdfghjkloiuztrewqasdfghjkoi,

CPAYLOAD are Blocks of ZPAYLOAD smaller then 1024*1024 Bytes which
are encrypted. Before encryption they might be padded with the
character `X'

ZPAYLOAD are Netstrings of PAYLOAD smaller then 1024*1024 Bytes which are 
compressed.

PAYLOAD are blocks of several messages smaller then 1024*1024 Bytes
consisting of two netstrings: The first is the name of the message and
the second is the Message itself. The name of a message must be a
valid FFS filename.

Example:

15:123.456.host.de,23:the first mail message
,16:567.890.host2.de,21:another mail message
,

Example of a complete data packet (using null encryption and compression):

+-- netstring containing a datablock of type P
|   +-- netstring with compressed data of the messages
|   |  +-- netstring with name of the first message 
|   |  |                  +-- netstring with the first message 
|   |  |                  |
96:P91:15:123.456.host.de,23:the first mail message
,15:567.890.host.de,21:another mail message
,,X,

A single Message can stretch through several payloads,
reassembling should be handeled by the client.

DELETIONREQUEST

Deletionrequests are netstrings containing the name of a Message which 
should be deleted by the server.

The server waits vor deletion requests until the client closes the
connection or until a timeout is reached.
